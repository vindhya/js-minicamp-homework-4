# Homework #4

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Callback Functions
		* A function is called a callback function when it is passed into another function as an argument. 
	* Closure
		* Closures are a feature of JavaScipt where functions "remember" the scope where they were defined. For example, a function defined inside an outer function will have access to the outer functin's parameters.
	* arguments array
		* The `arguments` array allows access to additional parameters used when a function was called even if those parameters don't exist in the definition of the function.
	* recursion
		* Recursion is when a function calls itself. It's important to have a base case so that the function doesn't continue recursing forever.
	* prototype
		* A prototype is like a framework for an object - it defines the properties and methods which the object has.
	* constructors
		* Constructors are a type of function which create a new instance of an object when called upon.


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.

	* git status
	* git commit -m "your commit message"
	* git push origin master

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.
